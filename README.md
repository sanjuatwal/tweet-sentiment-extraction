# tweet-sentiment-extraction

The advent of internet has changed the way people express their opinions. In this digital era , opinions are expressed in the form of product reviews , blogs or in a social media group. Social media generates huge volumes of data which has the ability to attract customers and influence them .People rely on generated content like reviews for decision making. This project aims in developing models for Tweet sentiment extraction using different Deep Learning techniques and classifying the sentiments under different categories like positive, negative and neutral. A variety of experimental models are implemented, trained and tested using different approaches. Twitter dataset is taken for testing and training. The results are analysed to determine the efficiency of the experimental outcomes of the models. 

RNNâ€™s (Recurrent neural networks) ,machine learning techniques and BERT are used to train the models on Twitter dataset. We have attempted to baseline a simple model using LSTM with Glove vector and then improve the performance to extract the maximum efficiency using 
(i) RNN architectures: LSTM ,SimpleRNN and GRU 
(ii)machine learning  techniques :logistic regression, linear Support Vector Machine and Random Forest classifier 
(iii)BERT. 
By far the performance on BERT exceeded the other solutions.
